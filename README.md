# Client-Power-Consumption-Forecasting
Power consumption forecasting model utilizing ensemble learning of LSTM networks in the development of a meta-model which explores the similarity and causality of clients and aggretates the results through stacked generalization in an MLP network.

The code contains the preprocessing of data and the experiments of this model in a case study involving a pool of electricity clients in Colombia. This work shows that combinatorial models utilizing similarity and causality in a meta-model structure can achieve better performance than standalone models and avoid overfitting when non-ideal scenarios of data collection are considered. Therefore, it is evident that more robust predictions can still be extracted without a heavy focus on the quality and availability of the data.

This project contains the code and experiments of my July-August 2021 publication. This work is a contribution towards my PhD studies.
